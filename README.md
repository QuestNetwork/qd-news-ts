## qD News

## Description

qD News is a module for [qDesk](https://qDesk.org). It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with [qD Messages](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qd-messages-ts), [qD Social](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qd-social-ts) and other qDesk modules. This module allows peers on the network to exchange, discuss and rate news items democratically.

Use [qOS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) in your applications and you can use the underlying channels and data in your own application by booting with [Quest News JS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-news-js).

qD News allows users to join the newsroom. It offers the ability to share news items and to discuss and collectively moderate news content. qDesk News is a module for [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) and it's built on [qOS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), our example app based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. The Quest Network is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

## Development

qDesk News is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
