## qDesk News

## Description

qDesk News is a module for [qDesk](https://qDesk.org). It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qDesk Messages, qDesk Social and other qDesk modules. This module allows peers on the network to exchange, discuss and rate news items democratically.

It's not all qDesk though, qDesk Social is a protocol as well and if you are using [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) in your applications.

qDesk News allows users to join the newsroom. It offers the ability to share news items and to discuss and collectively moderate news content. qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), our example app based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We're not planning to make this a decentralized version the "CNN" or "Fox News" threads of popular social networks. We're creating the real deal, a fully transparent, democratic and open source news platform. 

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

## Development

qDesk News is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
